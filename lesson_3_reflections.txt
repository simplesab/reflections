When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  I would use a remote repository when I want to share the repository between computers, so the usesrs on all of them can always work on the newest version. I can use that for me on more computers or for sharing with others.
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  If you store the last known state of the remote locally you can check against the new status of the remote and see if a pull requires a merge or not.
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
  Without Git or GitHub I would have to send the whole project from one computer to the others si that everybody was up to date. It would be easier 'cuz it would just be copy-paste but it would take longer. And I would not know what was modified and there would be no histry apart from what is created locally.
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
  I'd make changes in a separate branch when I wouldn't want to push everything to master before others have had the opportunity to check my changes.
